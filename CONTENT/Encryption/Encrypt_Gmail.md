## Encrypt Gmail

I'm able to use GnuPG to encrypt and decrypt Gmail messages when accessing my accounts via SMTP. but within the regular Gmail page on my browser — I use Mozilla for various reasons — I haven't found a way to do so.

20140131: [Mailvelope](https://github.com/toberndo/mailvelope/releases) seems to be working.

I see that

 * FireGPG seems to have been discontinued. (20140131)
 * WebPG has only a few reviews, and they're not such happy ones: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/webpg-firefox/reviews/. (20140131)
 * The GreaseMonkey script at http://www.langenhoven.com/code/emailencrypt/gmailencrypt.php has not been updated since 2010. (20140131)
