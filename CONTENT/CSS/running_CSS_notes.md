## Running CSS notes

 - two floats side by side: use `float: left;` in each; doesn't seem to work if only in parent
 - background no larger than foreground text: `display:inline-block;`, and set   `width:auto; height:auto;`
 - to use `top` with an object, need: `position:absolute;`
 - for table cell-content wrapping: `table {table-layout: fixed;} td {word-wrap: break-word;}`
 - replace old `valign` in CSS: `vertical-align`
