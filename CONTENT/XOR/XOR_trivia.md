How read
--------
 __aut__ http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Aut.html (20110327). I have heard this read "ought" in traditional English pronunciation of Latin, although the reconstructed Latin we are taught in schools renders it as English "out". Latin __aut__ was exclusive or; __vel__ was non-exclusive, and I wonder if the symbol ∨ for 'non-exclusive or' owes anything to ''vel''.
