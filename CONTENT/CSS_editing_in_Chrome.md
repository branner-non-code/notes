## Editing CSS in Chrome

 1. Open Developer Tools (command-option-i) or JavaScript Console (command-option-j)
 1. Click "Elements" tab. A half-window should open, showing several tabs.
 1. Click the "styles" tab there. You should see
 
         element.style {
         
         }
 1. Toward the top right of that area you should see a plus-sign. Click it, and you can (temporarily) add CSS rules.
