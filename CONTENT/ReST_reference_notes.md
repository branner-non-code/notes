## Restructured Text reference notes

ReST is a "lightweight markup language". This type descends from SGML (ISO standard dates to 1986) and IBM's GML (1969). Like AWK, GML is (or can be seen as) an acronym of its inventors' surnames.

   * "ReStructured text is more “capable,” in the sense that it allows me to represent many more kinds of semantic constructs, to embed backend code for latex and html and whatever-else (Markdown is HTML-specific in the sense that processors expect to be generating HTML), and it's more mature in that there is a specification and there aren't 50 different “flavors” of ReST out there."
   * "ReST is in some sense a superset of Markdown. … ReST is always notable for being designed with customization in mind. … If you're looking at more advanced needs like structuring whole documents and an extensible system that helps you with kinky stuff, ReST is the preferred choice."
   * "Markdown tends to be used more for things like blogging, discussion postings, and other applications like that. On the other hand, ReStructured Text (IIRC) was made specifically for being easy to insert into source code."
   * "To exemplify why I think RST fails, I think both double colons and double back-quotes are obscure and hard to get right."
   * "Markdown seems useful if you're mainly interested in generating HTML. ReStructuredText (and the related DocUtils suite) is good if you want to generate other structured output formats. … ReStructuredText is extensible."
