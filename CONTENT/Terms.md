## Words and jargon heard

 1. 20130227: **strftime** = _string from time_. This originates in C.
    But what about the corresponding function `strptime`? Perhaps
    _string produce time_?
 1. 20130227: **repl** used commonly in speech (as _repple_) for the
    Python interpreter and others: _read–eval–print loop_.
 1. 20130318: **domain knowledge**. Frequently used for _expertise_.
 1. 20130319: **fail whale**: token of an outage (has status of current
    jargon on Twitter).
 1. 20130326: **state**: essentially, non-static content.
 1. 20130401: **staged**: In Git, already tracked and now prepared for committing. The `add` command both begins tracking a file and stages a tracked file.
 1. 20130604: **Documentation communicates intent.** Heard at Python Study Group.
 1. 20130604: **corner cases**: rarefied edge cases. Heard at Python Study Group.
 1. 20140513: **reflection**: examination (optionally, with redefinition) of code either by the code itself or by a different piece of code.
 1. 20140513: **callback**: executable piece of code passed for later execution.
 1. 20140513: **classical**: common in discussion of JavaScript in the sense _class-based_ (e.g. Douglas Crockford's ["Classical Inheritance in JavaScript"](Classical Inheritance in JavaScript)); confusing because _classical_ seems to impute authority and antiquity to class-based paradigms, whereas authors using _classical_ in this sense are generally arguing for the superiority of a class-free paradigm.
 1.  20140513: **dogfood**: (v) to consume [one's own products] (said of a company).
