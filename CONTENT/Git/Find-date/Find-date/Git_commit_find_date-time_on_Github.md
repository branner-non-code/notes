## Find date/time of Git commit on Github

How to find the date of a commit on GitHub? At the level of the repo itself GitHub shows relative dates: "2 months ago", etc. 

To get more detail, take two steps: `repo => file => history`, and then beneath "History for repo / file" it shows the date of each commit containing that file.

 > If you hover over the "X units ago" text for a moment, your browser should display a tooltip with the exact date and time."
