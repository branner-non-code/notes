## Check-in week ending 20130823

### DONE

 1. The main piece of code I've been working on is ripe enough to be posted publicly: https://github.com/brannerchinese/ChineseUtilities/tree/master/separate_pinyin. This has immediate application in producing a Pīnyīn index for the PDF version of my dictionary. 
 1. Was exposed to the Chinese Biographical Database at Harvard. See http://www.tangstudies.org/Workshop.html. In addition, there were introductions to some proprietary GIS and Social Network Analysis tools.
 1. All the tools were Windows-only, although I was able to access the basic database itself with SQLite3 tools, since there was a SQLite3 version available. I may, however, look into GraphViz-based tools such as http://gephi.org/, since I can see the utility of these modeling programs for studying language.
 2. [Neglected to mention at the time: Prepared Yuhlaan shy content (initially collated in May, right after Hacker School) for incorporation into database. Created new private repo for this project.]
 3. [Neglected to mention at the time: Answered question about missing rime-names for student who is collating rhyming records for me.]

### TO-DO

 1. Must start `add_record` function for Mandarin dictionary.
