### To Do

#### Review of technical matter

  1. Hash tables — both direct and chained models. 
    2. Chained: Must decide when to resize array, and by how much. Perhaps keep track of how many slots contain chains. 
    3. Direct: Place collision-entry in an empty slot?
  1. Heaps.
  1. Binary search tree.

#### Mandarin dictionary

  1. Refactor command-line output.
  1. Refactor genertic SQL commands — some can be combined as joins.
  1. Adding characters for new entry not yet working.
  2. Adding an entry for characters not in the all-kanji table does not work.

#### Undergraduate student's thesis

  1. Found syntax error preventing compilation.
  2. Cleaned up repo.
  3. Added student's Proposal into the repo and added my own comments.
  4. Looked up standard rules on Git commit message style.
