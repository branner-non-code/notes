## Check-in week ending 20130920

### To Do

#### Mandarin dictionary

  1. Refactor command-line output.
  1. Refactor genertic SQL commands — some can be combined as joins.
  1. Adding characters for new entry not yet working.
  2. Adding an entry for characters not in the all-kanji table does not work.

#### Review of technical matter

  1. Hash tables — both direct and chained models. 
    2. Chained: Must decide when to resize array, and by how much.
    3. Direct: Place collision-entry in an empty slot?
  1. Heaps.
  1. Binary search tree.
