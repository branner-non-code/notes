### Mandarin dictionary

  1. 20130928. 20 items.

### Prosody

  1. Jī Kāng "四言贈兄秀才入軍詩"
    2. Syntactic mark-up mostly complete.
    2. Chose *Guǎngyùn* readings for foot-syllables.

### Other coding

  1. Issue #13 of Blaggregator code fixed. (https://github.com/sursh/blaggregator/issues/13) Problem (HTML entities appearing where original blog titles have Unicode) seems to have been on the deployment system, not the feed parsing module.
  2. Two items in pull-request to Blaggregator: tiny change to `README` and utility function added to `feedergrabber27.py`.

  2. Adding an entry for characters not in the all-kanji table does not work.
