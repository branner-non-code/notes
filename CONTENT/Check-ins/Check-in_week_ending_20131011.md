## Check-in week ending 20131011

### Prosody

### Character dictionary



### Review of technical matter

  1. Substrings. Now two versions of program to find longest substring with a limited number of unique characters: one using only a list, and the other using a set to identify unique characters and a list to keep track of the order in which characters were added to the set. Some small refactoring may still be necessary in the latter, but it seems that until input strings become very large, the latter program is slower than the former, despite the better lookup speed of sets.
