Okular

 1. 20130401. I have been using Okular to display PDFs with in my classes, on my Mac laptop. But it is distributed through MacPorts, which I have removed because of problems with Python3; I am using HomeBrew for ports now, and HomeBrew does not seem to support Okular. However, Chrome has very flexible support for PDF display, and I will be using that starting this week.
