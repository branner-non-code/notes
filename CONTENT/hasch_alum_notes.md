 * second-career people (from non-physics, non-coding backgrounds)
 * taking long view, accept that there are long-term gifts one is bestowing unawares, in teaching process; compare to need for gratification deferred in learning process (including coding)

I am what HR people call a "career-changer", and this makes me unlike the great majority of other Hacker Schoolers I have met these six months. Most of them have long experience coding, or degrees in computer science or other highly technical fields such as physics, or else work experience in
