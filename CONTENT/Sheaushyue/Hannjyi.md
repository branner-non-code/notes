## Using the Hanji site at Academia Sinica

### Basic instructions

 1. Go to http://hanji.sinica.edu.tw/
 1. Click 瀚典全文檢索系統 2.0 版 [mega-corpus full-text search system v. 2.0]. That will bring you to 資料庫 [database]
 1. There are quite a variety of different resources there; I mainly use 漢籍全文資料庫 [full-text database of Chinese books], 古漢語語料庫 [Ancient Chinese text database], and 文心雕龍 [the Wenshin diaulong text in several annotated editions]; there are also valuable sinological materials in 清代經世文編. Let's use 漢籍全文資料庫 as an example.
 1. Click the link 漢籍全文資料庫; once inside, click 免費使用 [no-charge use]. That brings up a search interface allowing access to (lower part of left panel) 
  * 經 [classics] 
  * 史 [histories] 
  * 子 [scholars] 
  * 集 [collections]
 The Classics (standard 13 Classics) and Histories are the most fully populated at this point. 
 1. Go back and try 古漢語語料庫; that is the best place to find major Classical Chinese texts like Juangtzyy.
