## Using the Hanji site at Academia Sinica

### Basic instructions

 1. Go to http://hanji.sinica.edu.tw/
 1. Click 瀚典全文檢索系統 2.0 版 [mega-corpus full-text search system v. 2.0]. That will bring you to 資料庫 [database]
 1. There are quite a variety of different resources there; I mainly use 漢籍全文資料庫 [full-text database of Chinese books] and 文心雕龍 [the Wenshin diaulong text in several annotated editions]; there are also valuable sinological materials in 清代經世文編. Let's use 漢籍全文資料庫 as an example.
 1. Click the link 漢籍全文資料庫; once inside, click 免費使用 [no-charge use]. That brings up a search interface allowing access to (lower part of left panel) 經 [classics] 史 [histories] 子 [thinkers] 集 [collections]. 
 
[end]
