## How pull requests work

1. Fork on Github (if you don't already have a fork of the project)
2. Clone your repository to your own computer (if you don't already have a copy of it)
3. Make a branch from master for your changes
4. Make changes
5. Commit your changes
6. Push your branch to Github
7. Make a pull request
8. If there are comments, repeat 4-6 until the maintainers are happy with it.
