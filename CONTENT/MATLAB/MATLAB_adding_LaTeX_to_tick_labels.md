## MATLAB - adding LaTeX to tick labels

> "Matlab plots generally support LaTeX markup for the various components, including axes labels, legends, annotations, etc. However, one of the few exceptions are the axis tick labels, that is the data values alongside each axis, regardless of whether they are set automatically or manually by the user. Since in many situations it becomes necessary to use LaTeX in the tick labels, either to include mathematical expressions such as fractions, or simply to maintain a uniform look-and-feel, the Matlab code on this page enables this functionality without any change to normal plotting functions."
