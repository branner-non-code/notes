## MATLAB access for CCNY students

### Getting started

20110324. For students to use the Campus license, they need to contact the Science Computing Service (SCS), 212-650-7885 or <MatLab@sci.ccny.cuny.edu>. The SCS will need the student's CCNY email address in order to do the paperwork to get access to the software, but the procedures were pretty straightforward, even though a bit time-consuming. It is *very* helpful having this software on my own machine, since I can practice with it here.

### Getting TAH license and having it activated

> In order for us to grant the Matlab user license key and online download access, we first need to verify the user's CUNY CCNY email address. After verification, the user will need to go to the MathWorks website at www.mathworks.com and create a MathWorks account using a valid ccny email address. It is critical that the user inputs his ccny email address correctly so that we can access and associate the user with a TAH license. In the drop down activation menu set up, verify that MathWorks is set to Academic use.  If all setup is successfully completed, we will remotely activate the license key and send an email notifying the user that the account is ready for download on a particular computer.

### To download

On the MathWorks website, click on the latest release and follow the instructions to download.
