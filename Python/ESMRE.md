ESMRE (Efficient String Matching, Regex)
----------------------------------------

[https://code.google.com/p/esmre/] (accessed 20130403, referred by Bill Abresch)

"esmre is a Python module that can be used to speed up the execution of a large collection of regular expressions. It works by building a index of compulsory substrings from a collection of regular expressions, which it uses to quickly exclude those expressions which trivially do not match each input."
