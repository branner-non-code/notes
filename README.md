# Notes

A simple indexer for Markdown files stored in a GitHub repository. No server-side support or database is needed, although an index must be generated using Python (not on GitHub).

**Please go to the [gh-pages branch](https://github.com/branner-non-code/notes/tree/gh-pages) of this repository to use it.**
