Notes

[Search markdown files here](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/brannerchinese/notes/blob/master/tester.html)

Assorted notes -- chiefly for my own reference -- having to do with coding. Most involve either syntax or solutions to problems.

Markdown files are indexed on my computer with `index_git.py`, which runs on Python v. 2.7 (in order to make use of the NLTK library). There is no database or server-side support. The index is stored as two large JavaScript objects in the `JS/` directory.

The initial material was composed in LaTeX but converted to Markdown using [PanDoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc).
