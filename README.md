[Search markdown files here](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/brannerchinese/notes/blob/master/tester.html)

Assorted notes — chiefly for my own reference — having to do with coding. Most involve either syntax or solutions to problems.

Index markdown files are indexed in your local repo using `index_git.py`, which runs under Python v. 2.7 (in order to make use of the NLTK library). There is no database or server-side support. The index is stored as two large JavaScript objects in the `JS/` directory.

When your local repo is pushed to GitHub, the link "Search markdown files here" will open a new page with a search form, from which searches of the .md file tiles, directories, and headers can be done.

The earliest material in this collection was composed in LaTeX but converted to Markdown using [PanDoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc). Most material since then has been written from scratch or converted from [MoinMoin markdown](http://moinmo.in/ParserMarket/Markdown).
