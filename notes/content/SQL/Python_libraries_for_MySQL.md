## Python libraries for MySQL

### MySQL-python

`MySQL-python` seems to have been the standard. It is up to v. 1.3:
https://github.com/farcepest/MySQLdb1/tree/MySQLdb-1.3.

It is being refactored as `moist` (https://github.com/farcepest/moist) but development seems to have stalled four years ago.

`MySQLdb` is the name of the actual module you import.
