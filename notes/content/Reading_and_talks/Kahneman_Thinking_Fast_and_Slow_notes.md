# Kahneman, _Thinking, Fast and Slow_ — notes

## Ch. 1 The Characters of the Story

### 1 Two systems

 * p. 20 System 1: "operates automatically and quickly, with little or no effort and no sense of voluntary control."

 * p. 21 System 2: "subjective experience of agency, choice, and concentration."

 * p. 23 "Everyone has some awareness of the limited capacity of attention."

 * Chabris and Simons, _The Invisible Gorilla_.

 * p. 24 "We can be blind to the obvious, and we are also blind to our blindness."

### 2 Plot synopsis

 * p. 24 "System 1 runs automatically and System 2 is normally in a comfortable low-effort mode, in which only a fraction of its capacity is engaged."

 * "System 1 continuously generates suggestions for System 2: impressions, intuitions, intentions, and feelings."

 * "If endorsed by System 2, impressions and intuitions turn into beliefs, and impulses turn into voluntary actions."

 * "When all goes smoothly, which is most of the time, System 2 adopts the suggestions of System 1 with little or not modification. You generally believe your impressions and act on your desires."

 * "When System 1 runs into difficulty, it calls on System 2 to support more detailed and specific processing that may solve the problem of the moment. System 2 is mobilized when a question arises for which System one does not offer and answer. … System 2 is also credited with the continuous monitoring of your own behavior."

 * p. 25 "In summary, most of what you (your system 2) think and do originates in your System 1, but System 2 takes over when things get difficult, and it normally has the last word."

 * "The division of labor between System 1 and System 2 is highly efficient: it minimizes effort and optimizes performance."

 * "System 1 sometimes answers easier questions than the one it was asked, and it has little understanding of logic and statistics. One further limitation of System 1 is that it cannot be turned off."

### 3 Conflict

 * p. 25 Stroop test: color words printed in different colors

 * p. 26 "One of the tasks of System 2 is to overcome the impulses of System 1."

### 4 Illusions

 * p. 27 Müller-Lyer illusion: lines of same length that appear to be of different length

 * Cognitive illusions

 * p. 28 Psychopathic charm

 * "System 2 is much too slow and inefficient to serve as a substitute for System 1 in making routine decisions. The best we can do is a compromise: learn to recognize situations in which mistakes are likely and try harder to avoid significant mistakes when the stakes are high."

 * "The premise of this book is that it is easier to recognize other people's mistakes than our own."

### 5 Useful fictions

 * p. 29 System 1 and System 2 as fictitious characters that make the book's narrative effective.

 * "Systems 1 and 2 are not systems in the standard sense of entities with interacting aspects or parts."

 * "Automatic system" vs. "effortful system".

## Ch. 2 Attention and Effort

### 1 Mental effort

 * p. 31 Add-1 (4 digits) and Add-3 tasks

 * p. 32 "You will find in the changing size of your pupils a faithful record of how hard you worked." (greater dilation indicates more effort)

 * Eckard Hess, "Attitude and Pupil Size" (1965)

 * "Pupils are sensitive indicators of mental effort. … The response to mental effort it distinct from emotional arousal."

 * p. 34 "Mental life … is normally conducted at the pace of a comfortable walk, sometimes interrupted by episodes of jogging and on rare occasions by a frantic sprint."

 * Failure to detect letters flashed while exerting greatest mental effort. (Recall _Invisible Gorilla_.)

 * p. 35 "The response to mental overload is selective and precise: System 2 protects the most important activity, so it receives the attention it needs; 'spare capacity' is allocated second by second to other tasks."

 * "System 1 takes over in emergencies and assigns total priority to self-protective actions."

 * Jackson Beatty, authority on cognitive pupillometry.

 * "A general 'law of least effort' applies to cognitive as well as physical exertion. The law asserts that if there are several ways of achieving the same goal, people will eventually gravitate to the least demanding course of action."

 * p. 36 "System 2 is the only one that can follow rules, compare objects on several attributes, and make deliberate choices between options."

 * "System 1 detects simple relations and excels at integrating information about one thing, but it does not deal with multiple distinct topics at once, nor is it adept at using purely statistical information."

 * "A crucial capability of System 2 is the adoption of 'task sets': it can program memory to obey an instruction that overrides habitual responses."

 * p. 37 executive control: "the adoption and termination of task sets"

 * "Switching from one task to another is effortful, especially under time pressure."

 * "Modern tests of working memory require the individual to switch repeatedly between two demanding tasks, retaining the results of one operation while performing the other."

 * p. 38 "We cover long distances by taking our time and conduct our mental lives by the law of least effort."

## Ch. 3 The Lazy Controller

### 1 [no subtitle]

 * p. 39 "The mild physical arousal of the walk may spill over into greater mental alertness."

 * "System 2 also has a natural speed. … At the extremes, these activities appear to compete for the limited resources of System 2."

 * p. 40 Self-control and deliberate thought apparently draw on the same limited budget of effort."

 * Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, "flow": "the state of effortless attending"

 * p. 41 In a state of flow, … maintaining focused attention on these absorbing activities requires no exertion of self-control, thereby freeing resources to be directed to the task at hand."

### 2 The busy and depleted System 2

 * p. 41 "System 1 has more influence on behavior when System 2 is busy, and it has a sweet tooth."

 * Roy Baumeister: all variants of voluntary effort … draw partly on a shared pool of mental energy.

 * p. 41-42 "ego-depletion": "If you have had to force yourself to do something, you are less willing or less able to exert self-control when the next challenge comes around."

 * p. 42 "activities that impose high demands on System 2 require self-control, and the exertion of self-control is depleting and unpleasant."

 * "Unlike cognitive load, ego depletion is at least in part a loss of motivation."

 * p. 43 "The nervous system consumes more glucose than most other parts of the body, and effortful mental activity appears to be especially expensive in the currency of glucose. When you are actively involved in difficult cognitive reasoning or engaged in a task that requires self-control, your blood glucose level drops. … The bold implication of this idea is that the effects of ego depletion could be undone by ingesting glucose."

 * effect of glucose-depletion on parole judges

### 3 The lazy System 2

 * p. 44 "One of the main functions of System 2 is to monitor and control thoughts and actions 'suggested' by System 1, allowing some to be expressed directly in behavior and suppressing or modifying others."

 * Shane Frederick: bat-and-ball puzzle

 * p. 45 "many people are overconfident, prone to place too much faith in their intuitions."

 * flowers/roses/fading syllogism

 * "When people believe a conclusion is true, they are also very likely to believe arguments that appear to support it, even when these arguments are unsound. If System 1 is involved, the conclusion comes first and the arguments follow."

 * p. 45-46 Shane Frederick: how many murders occur in the state of Michigan in one year? — "trick": Detroit, a high-crime city, is in Michigan.

 * "Memory function is an attribute of System 1. … The extent of deliberate checking and search is a characteristic of System 2, which varies among individuals."

 * "Failing these minitests appears to be, at least to some extent, a matter of insufficient motivation."

 * "Those who avoid the sin of intellectual sloth could be called 'engaged.' … Keith Stanovich would call them more rational."

### 4 Intelligence, Control, Rationality

 * p. 47 Walter Mischel: immediate small reward vs. large reward deferred under difficult conditions. "Ten of fifteen years later, a large gap had opened between those who had resisted temptation and those who had not. The resisters had higher measures of executive control in cognitive tasks, and especially the ability to reallocate their attention effectively."

 * pp. 47-48 The testers found that training attention not only improved executive control; scores on nonverbal tests of intelligence also improved and the improvement was maintained for several months."

 * Shane Frederick: "cognitive reflection tests". (See Ch. 5)

 * "Individuals who uncritically follow their intuitions about puzzles are also prone to accept other suggestions from System 1. In particular, they are impulsive, impatient, and keen to receive immediate gratification."

 * "System 1 is impulsive and intuitive; System 2 is capable of reasoning, and it is cautious, but at least for some people it is also lazy."

 * Keith Stanovich and Richard West: "System 1 and System 2", "Type 1 and Type 2 processes".

 * pp. 48-49 Keith Stanovich, _Rationality and the Reflective Mind_. distinction between two parts of System 2: "separate minds". "Algorithmic" mind "deals with slow thinking and demanding computation."

 * "Stanovich argues that high intelligence doies not make people immune to biases. Another ability is involved, which he labels rationality. … The core of his argument is that rationality should be distinguished from intelligence. In his view, superficial or 'lazy' thinking is a flaw in the reflective mind, a failure of rationality." 

 * "The bat-and-ball question and others like it are somewhat better indicators of our susceptibility to cognitive errors than are conventional measures of intelligence."

## Ch. 4 The Associative Machine

### 1 [no subtitle]

 * pp. 50 Example of bananas + vomit. "Your mind automatically assumed a temporal sequence and a causal connection. … The state of your memory has changed in other ways: you are now unusually ready to recognize and respond to objects and concepts associated with" the two words. 

 * p. 51 "Your System 1 noticed the fact that the juxtaposition of the two words is uncommon."

 * This System 1 response is called **associative activation**: "ideas that have been evoked trigger many other ideas, in a spreading cascade of activity in your brain. The essential feature of this complex set of mental events is its coherence. … All this happens quickly and all at once, yielding a self-reinforcing pattern of cognitive, emotional, and physical responses that is both diverse and integrated — it has been called **associatively coherent**."

 * "System 1 made as much sense as possible of the situation … by linking the words in a causal story; it evaluated the possible threat (mild to moderate) and created a context for future developments by preparing you for events that had just become more likely; it also created a context for the current event by evaluating how surprising it was."

 * "System 1 treated the mere conjunction of two words as representations of reality."

 * "Cognition is embodied; you think with your body, not only with your brain."

 * pp. 51-52. **association of ideas**. David Hume's principles: "resemblance, contiguity in time and place, and causality."

 * "We no longer think of the mind as going through a sequence of conscious ideas, one at a time. … A great deal happens at once. … Most of the work of associative thinking is silent, hidden from our conscious selves."

### 2 The marvels of priming

 * P. 52 Measurement of **priming effects** is better than self-reported word-association tests.

 * P. 53 "Priming is not restricted to concepts and words."

 * John Bargh: "**Florida effect**": "words with an elderly theme" => walking slowly.

 * Pp. 53-54 "**Ideomotor** effect": Two stages of priming: 1) words prime thoughts; 2) thoughts prime behavior.

 * Reverse "**Florida effect**" also observe: walking slowly => "words with an elderly theme"

 * "Reciprocal links are common in the associative network."

 * Fritz Strack; Ulf Dimberg: Forcing "smiling" or "frowning" using a pencil held in the month => changes in how funny 

 * Gary L. Wells: nodding while listening to editorial => accepting the message

### 3 Primes that guide us

 * P. 56 Priming by having referendum polled in school => greater support for school funding

 * Priming with images of classrooms and school lockers => greater support for school funding

 * Pp. 55-56 Kathleen Vohs: Money-priming => individualism (independence, selfishness, preference for being alone)

 * Reminding people of their mortality => appeal of authoritarian ideas

 * P. 56 "Lady Macbeth effect": Thinking of being ashamed => words wash, soap; thinking of stabbing a coworker => buying detergent, soap, disinfectant

 * P. 57 "Disbelief is not an option. ... Priming phenomena arise in System 1."

 * Pp. 57-58 Effect of image if eyes on "honesty box" for coffee and tea money

 * P. 58 "System 1 provides the impressions that often turn into your beliefs, and it is the source of the impulses that often become your choices and your actions. It offers a tacit interpretation of what happens to you and around you. ... It contains the model of the world that instantly evaluates events as normal or surprising. It is the source of your rapid and often precise intuitive judgments. ... System 1 is also ... The origin of many of the systematic errors in your intuitions."
