## Ch. 2. The Sentence

### 2.1 General Observations

#### 2.1.1 The Sentence as a Unit

#### 2.1.2 Sentence Identity

 * "utterance": "an instance of the occurrence of a sentence" (author's special usage)
 * "In the language of communication theory, a sentence is a 'type', while and utterance is a 'token' of the type."
 * "Since most systems of writing omit indication of significant prosodic elements, one should always remember that the same sequence of words may not represent the same sentence." Example:
 
   * _ta tzoou [,] bu hao_
   * _ta tzoou.bu-hao_

 * "Exceptionally, two or more different sentences can still have exactly the same phonemic make up and thus are homophonous sentences." Example:
 
   * _woo yaw chie-gau_: dpb: S Aux VO
   * _woo yaw chie-gau_: dpb: S Aux (Attr)-O

#### 2.1.3 Sentence Values

 1. **declarative sentence**: "is true or false and thus has truth value"
 1. **command**: "is either complied with or refused and has compliance value". [Two sentences] do not have the same compliance value if they are not satisfied by quite the same action. Examples:
 
    * _Sonq ta jeh san-been shu!_ `==` _Bae jeh san-been shu sonq geei ta!_
    * " `!=` _Sonq ta san-been shu_
 
 1. **question**: "has information value". "Two questions which will be satisfied by the same information have the same information value." Example:
 
    * _Nii jii-suey_ `!=` _Nii shyrjii-suey_. "The ranges of information for them are different."
    
    "A question may be regarded as a species of command and can usually be so reworded as such formally": _Gaw.sonq woo…_

 1. **vocative expression**: "has attention value"
 1. **exclamation**: "has expressive value: … giving the same degree and kind of affective reaction in both spekaer and hearer". ("This is usually hard to determine.")

#### 2.1.4 Sentence and Use of a Sentence

 * "The sentence value is not so much tied up with a sentence as a type, but rather with its use.

### 2.2 Minor Sentences

#### [No heading, start of section 2.2]

 * "A full sentence consists of two parts, a subject and a predicate."
 * "A minor sentence is not in the subject-predicate form."
 * "Most minor sentences are either verbal expressions or nominal expressions."
 * "Interjections, though forming only a small proportion of minor sentences, are … minor sentences par excellence."
 * Example: _shiah-yeu le_: minor declarative sentence.
