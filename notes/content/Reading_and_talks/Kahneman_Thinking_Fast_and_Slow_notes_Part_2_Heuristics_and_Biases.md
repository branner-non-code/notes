# Kahneman, _Thinking, Fast and Slow_ — notes. Part 2 Heuristics and Biases

## Ch. 10. The Law of Small Numbers

### 1 [No subtitle]

 * p. 110-11: Wainer and Zwerling, cancer rates. “System 1 is inept when faced with ‘merely statistical’ facts, which change the probability of outcomes but do not cause them to happen.”
 
   * example of low kidney cancer rates in rural, Republican-leaning counties. “It is both easy and tempting to infer that their low cancer rates are directly due to the clean living of the rural lifestyle.”
   * example of high kidney cancer rates in rural, Republican-leaning counties. “It is both easy and tempting to infer that their high cancer rates are directly due to the poverty of the rural lifestyle.”
   * “The key factor is not that the counties were rural or predominantly Republican. It is that rural counties have small populations.”

 * p. 111: “The satisfying sense of causation that you experience when thinking of a hammer hitting an egg is altogether absent when you think about sampling.”
 
 * “Extreme outcomes (both high and low) are more likely to be found in small rather than in large samples. This explanation is not causal. ... The deeper truth is that there is nothing to explain. ... The differences between dense and rural counties do not really count as facts: they are ... artifacts, observations that are produced entirely by some aspect of the method of research — in this case, by differences in sample size.”
 
 * “The following two statements mean exactly the same thing:
 
   * “Large samples are more precise than small samples.
   * “Small samples yield extreme results more often than large samples do.”

 * p. 112: “Even sophisticated researchers have poor intuitions and a wobbly understanding of sampling effects.”

### 2 The law of small numbers

 * p. 112: “The risk of error can be estimated for any given sample size by a fairly simple procedure. Traditionally, however, psychologists do not use calculations to decide on a sample size. They use their judgment, which is commonly flawed.”
 
 * p. 113: Tversky and Kahneman: “the law of small numbers, which asserts that the law of large numbers applies to small numbers as well”

### 3 A bias of confidence over doubt

 * p. 114: “System 1 is not prone to doubt. It suppresses ambiguity and spontaneously constructs stories that are as coherent as possible. Unless the message is immediately negated, the associations that it evokes will spread as if the message were true. System 2 is capable of doubt, because it can maintain incompatible possibilities at the same time. … The law of small numbers is a manifestation of a general bias that favors certainty over doubt.”
 
 * “We are prone to exaggerate the consistency and coherence of what we see. … A machine for jumping to conclusions will act as if it believed in the law of small numbers. More generally, it will produce a representation of reality that makes too much sense.”

### 4 Cause and chance

 * pp. 114-15: “The associative machinery seeks causes. The difficulty we have with statistical regularities is that they call for a different approach. Instead of focusing on how the event at hand came to be, the statistical view relates it to what could have happened instead. Nothing in particular caused it to be what it is — chance selected it from among its alternatives.”
 
 * p. 115: “Our predilection for causal thinking exposes us to serious mistakes in evaluating the randomness of truly random events. … Random processes produce many sequences that convince people that the process is not random after all. You can see why assuming causality could have had evolutionary advantages. It is part of the general vigilance that we have inherited from ancestors. We are automatically on the lookout for the possibility that the environment has changed.”
 
 * pp. 115-16: William Feller: Mapping the WWII bombing of London “revealed conspicuous gaps” in geographic distribution, assumed to be where German spies were living. Feller: “To the untrained eye randomness appears as regularity or tendency to cluster”
 
 * p. 116: Kahneman advised Israeli Air Force officers that different bombing damage to different bases was “due to blind luck and that the interviewing of the pilots should stop.”
 
 * pp. 116-17: Tversky, Gilovich et al., study of “hot hand” in basketball. “The hot hand is a massive and widespread cognitive illusion.” Conclusions rejected by coach of Boston Celtics.
 
 * p. 117: “If you follow your intuition, you will more often than not err by misclassifying a random event as systematic. We are far too willing to reject the belief that much of what we see in life is random.”
 
 * pp. 117-18: Wainer and Zwerling, study of Gates Foundation support for smaller schools. “The truth is that small schools are not better on average; they are simply more variable. If anything, … large schools tend to produce better results, especially in higher grades where a variety of curricular options is valuable.”
 
 * p. 118: “The law of small numbers is part of two larger stories about the workings of the mind.
 
   * “We pay more attention to the content of messages than to information about their reliability, and as a result end up with a view of the world around us that is simpler and more coherent than the data justify.”
   * “Statistics produce many observations that appear to beg for causal explanations but do not lend themselves to such explanations. Many facts of the world are due to chance, including accidents of sampling. Causal explanations of chance events are inevitably wrong.”

## Ch. 11. Anchors

### 1 [No subtitle]

 * p. 118: Tversky and Kahnman: rigged wheel of fortune to prime later numerical guesses. “**Anchoring effect**”: “It occurs when people consider a particular value for an unknown quantity before estimating that quantity. … The estimates stay close to the number that people considered — hence the image of an anchor.
 
 * p. 119: “Two different mechanisms produce anchoring effects — one for each system. There is a form of anchoring that occurs in a deliberate process of adjustment, an operation of System 2. And there is anchoring the occurs by a priming effect, and automatic manifestation of System 1.”

### 2 Anchoring as adjustment

 * p. 120: “Start from an anchoring number, assess whether it is too high or too low, and gradually adjust your estimate by mentally ‘moving’ from the anchor. The adjustment typically ends prematurely, because people stop when they are no longer certain that they should move farther.”
 
 * p. 121: “Insufficient adjustment neatly explains why you are likely to drive too fast when you come off the highway onto city streets — especially if you are talking with someone as you drive. Insufficient adjustment is also a source of tension between exasperated parents and teenagers who enjoy loud music in their room.”
 
 * pp. 121-22: Epley and Gilovich: “Adjustment is a deliberate attempt to find reasons to move away from the anchor. … Adjustment is an effortful operation. … Insufficient adjustment is a failure of a weak or lazy System 2.”

### 3 Anchoring as a priming effect

 * p. 122: “Adjustment is a deliberate and conscious activity, but in most cases of anchoring there is no corresponding subjective experience.”
 
 * “System 1 understands sentences by trying to make them true, and the selective activation of compatible thoughts produces a family of systematic errors that make us gullible and prone to believe too strongly whatever we believe.”
 
 * p. 123: Mussweiler and Strack: question about annual mean temperature in Germany; higher or lower suggested mean temperatures prime easier recognition of words related to summer or winter. “The selective activation of compatible memories explains anchoring.”
 
 *  Another study in which questions about average prices prime the names of luxury vs. mass-market brands.

### 4 The anchoring index

 * p. 123: “Anchoring can be measured, and it is an impressively large effect.”
 
 * Example of proportion of African nations at the UN; different responses corresponding to different numbers suggested in the question.
 
 * pp. 123-24. **Anchoring index**: “the ratio of the two differences expressed as a percentage.” Assuming two anchors, the difference between two corresponding estimates and the difference between the two anchors. 
 
 * **Anchoring measure**: “100% for people who slavishly adopt the anchor as an estimate, and zero for people who are able to ignore the anchor altogether.”
 
 * pp. 124-25: Examples of measured anchoring:
 
   * Estimating height of tallest redwood.

   * Pricing a house (with listed price shown). “The only difference between the two groups was that the students conceded that they were influenced by the anchor, while the professionals denied that influence.”

   * Making annual contributions to save seabirds from oil spills. “This question requires intensity matching: the respondents are asked, in effect, to find the dollar amount of a contribution that matches the intensity of their feelings about the plight of the seabirds.”
   
   * Acceptable increase in living costs if one could live in a less polluted region.
   
   * “Online trading, where the same item is often offered at different ‘buy now’ prices.”

 * pp. 125-26: Use of random anchors.
 
   * last digits of social security number, to estimate number of physicians in a city. “Anchors do not have their effects because people believe they are informative.”
   
   * roll of dice before sentencing a shoplifter to some number of months in prison.

### 5 Uses and abuses of anchors

 * p. 126: “Anchoring effects explain why, for example, arbitrary rationing is an effective marketing ploy.” Examples:
 
   * Limits on number of purchases during a sale: limit on number of purchases corresponds to higher average number of purchases.
 
   * Negotiating a price: initial price (or list price) serves as an anchor. “Moving first is an advantage in single-issue negotiations.”

 * pp. 126-27: Resisting anchoring effect in negotiations. Galinsky and Mussweiler: Activate System 2 by focusing attention and searching memory for arguments against the anchor. “The anchoring effect is reduced or eliminated when the second mover focuses his attention on the minimal offer that the opponent would accept, or on the costs to the opponent of failing to reach an agreement.”
 
 * “A strategy of deliberately ‘thinking the opposite’ may be a good defense against anchoring effects, because it negates the biased recruitment of thoughts that produces these effects.”
 
 * Question of capping the size of damages in personal injury cases. “This rule would eliminate all larger awards, but the anchor would also pull up the size of many awards that would otherwise be much smaller. It would almost certainly benefit serious offenders and large firms much more than small ones.”

### 6 Anchoring and the two systems

 * p. 127: “System 2 works on data that is retrieved from memory, in an automatic an involuntary operation of System 1. System 2 is therefore susceptible to the biasing influence of anchors that make some information easier to retrieve. Furthermore, System 2 has no control over the effect and no knowledge of it.”
 
 * pp. 127-28: “A message, unless it is immediately rejected as a lie, will have the same effect on the associative system regardless of its reliability. … Anchoring results from this associative activation. … The powerful effect of random anchors is an extreme case of this phenomenon, because a random anchor obviously provides no information at all.”
 
 * p. 128: “The main moral of priming research is that our thoughts and our behavior are influenced, much more than we know or want, by the environment of the moment. … Anchoring effects are threatening in a similar way. You are always aware of the anchor and even pay attention to it, but you do not know how it guides and constrains your thinking, because you cannot imagine how you would have thought if the anchor had been different (or absent). However, you should assume that any number that is on the table has had an anchoring effect on you, and if the stakes are high you should mobilize yourself (your System 2) to combat the effect.”
