# Kahneman, _Thinking, Fast and Slow_ — notes. Part 1 Two Systems

## Ch. 1 The Characters of the Story

### 1 Two systems

 * p. 20: System 1: "operates automatically and quickly, with little or no effort and no sense of voluntary control."

 * p. 21: System 2: "subjective experience of agency, choice, and concentration."

 * p. 23: "Everyone has some awareness of the limited capacity of attention."

 * Chabris and Simons, _The Invisible Gorilla_.

 * p. 24: "We can be blind to the obvious, and we are also blind to our blindness."

### 2 Plot synopsis

 * p. 24: "System 1 runs automatically and System 2 is normally in a comfortable low-effort mode, in which only a fraction of its capacity is engaged."

 * "System 1 continuously generates suggestions for System 2: impressions, intuitions, intentions, and feelings."

 * "If endorsed by System 2, impressions and intuitions turn into beliefs, and impulses turn into voluntary actions."

 * "When all goes smoothly, which is most of the time, System 2 adopts the suggestions of System 1 with little or not modification. You generally believe your impressions and act on your desires."

 * "When System 1 runs into difficulty, it calls on System 2 to support more detailed and specific processing that may solve the problem of the moment. System 2 is mobilized when a question arises for which System one does not offer and answer. … System 2 is also credited with the continuous monitoring of your own behavior."

 * p. 25: "In summary, most of what you (your system 2) think and do originates in your System 1, but System 2 takes over when things get difficult, and it normally has the last word."

 * "The division of labor between System 1 and System 2 is highly efficient: it minimizes effort and optimizes performance."

 * "System 1 sometimes answers easier questions than the one it was asked, and it has little understanding of logic and statistics. One further limitation of System 1 is that it cannot be turned off."

### 3 Conflict

 * p. 25: Stroop test: color words printed in different colors

 * p. 26: "One of the tasks of System 2 is to overcome the impulses of System 1."

### 4 Illusions

 * p. 27: Müller-Lyer illusion: lines of same length that appear to be of different length

 * Cognitive illusions

 * p. 28: Psychopathic charm

 * "System 2 is much too slow and inefficient to serve as a substitute for System 1 in making routine decisions. The best we can do is a compromise: learn to recognize situations in which mistakes are likely and try harder to avoid significant mistakes when the stakes are high."

 * "The premise of this book is that it is easier to recognize other people's mistakes than our own."

### 5 Useful fictions

 * p. 29: System 1 and System 2 as fictitious characters that make the book's narrative effective.

 * "Systems 1 and 2 are not systems in the standard sense of entities with interacting aspects or parts."

 * "Automatic system" vs. "effortful system".

## Ch. 2 Attention and Effort

### 1 Mental effort

 * p. 31: Add-1 (4 digits) and Add-3 tasks

 * p. 32: "You will find in the changing size of your pupils a faithful record of how hard you worked." (greater dilation indicates more effort)

 * Eckard Hess, "Attitude and Pupil Size" (1965). "Pupils are sensitive indicators of mental effort. … The response to mental effort it distinct from emotional arousal."

 * p. 34: "Mental life … is normally conducted at the pace of a comfortable walk, sometimes interrupted by episodes of jogging and on rare occasions by a frantic sprint."

 * Failure to detect letters flashed while exerting greatest mental effort. (Recall _Invisible Gorilla_.)

 * p. 35: "The response to mental overload is selective and precise: System 2 protects the most important activity, so it receives the attention it needs; 'spare capacity' is allocated second by second to other tasks."

 * "System 1 takes over in emergencies and assigns total priority to self-protective actions."

 * Jackson Beatty, authority on cognitive pupillometry.

 * "A general 'law of least effort' applies to cognitive as well as physical exertion. The law asserts that if there are several ways of achieving the same goal, people will eventually gravitate to the least demanding course of action."

 * p. 36: "System 2 is the only one that can follow rules, compare objects on several attributes, and make deliberate choices between options."

 * "System 1 detects simple relations and excels at integrating information about one thing, but it does not deal with multiple distinct topics at once, nor is it adept at using purely statistical information."

 * "A crucial capability of System 2 is the adoption of 'task sets': it can program memory to obey an instruction that overrides habitual responses."

 * p. 37: executive control: "the adoption and termination of task sets"

 * "Switching from one task to another is effortful, especially under time pressure."

 * "Modern tests of working memory require the individual to switch repeatedly between two demanding tasks, retaining the results of one operation while performing the other."

 * p. 38: "We cover long distances by taking our time and conduct our mental lives by the law of least effort."

## Ch. 3 The Lazy Controller

### 1 [no subtitle]

 * p. 39: "The mild physical arousal of the walk may spill over into greater mental alertness."

 * "System 2 also has a natural speed. … At the extremes, these activities appear to compete for the limited resources of System 2."

 * p. 40: Self-control and deliberate thought apparently draw on the same limited budget of effort."

 * Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi. **Flow**: "the state of effortless attending"

 * p. 41: In a state of flow, … maintaining focused attention on these absorbing activities requires no exertion of self-control, thereby freeing resources to be directed to the task at hand."

### 2 The busy and depleted System 2

 * p. 41: "System 1 has more influence on behavior when System 2 is busy, and it has a sweet tooth."

 * Roy Baumeister. "All variants of voluntary effort … draw partly on a shared pool of mental energy."

 * p. 41-42: "ego-depletion": "If you have had to force yourself to do something, you are less willing or less able to exert self-control when the next challenge comes around."

 * p. 42: "activities that impose high demands on System 2 require self-control, and the exertion of self-control is depleting and unpleasant."

 * "Unlike cognitive load, ego depletion is at least in part a loss of motivation."

 * p. 43: "The nervous system consumes more glucose than most other parts of the body, and effortful mental activity appears to be especially expensive in the currency of glucose. When you are actively involved in difficult cognitive reasoning or engaged in a task that requires self-control, your blood glucose level drops. … The bold implication of this idea is that the effects of ego depletion could be undone by ingesting glucose."

 * effect of glucose-depletion on parole judges

### 3 The lazy System 2

 * p. 44: "One of the main functions of System 2 is to monitor and control thoughts and actions 'suggested' by System 1, allowing some to be expressed directly in behavior and suppressing or modifying others."

 * Shane Frederick. Bat-and-ball puzzle.

 * p. 45: "many people are overconfident, prone to place too much faith in their intuitions."

 * flowers/roses/fading syllogism

 * "When people believe a conclusion is true, they are also very likely to believe arguments that appear to support it, even when these arguments are unsound. If System 1 is involved, the conclusion comes first and the arguments follow."

 * p. 45-46: Shane Frederick. How many murders occur in the state of Michigan in one year? — "trick": Detroit, a high-crime city, is in Michigan.

 * "Memory function is an attribute of System 1. … The extent of deliberate checking and search is a characteristic of System 2, which varies among individuals."

 * "Failing these minitests appears to be, at least to some extent, a matter of insufficient motivation."

 * "Those who avoid the sin of intellectual sloth could be called 'engaged.' … Keith Stanovich would call them more rational."

### 4 Intelligence, Control, Rationality

 * p. 47: Walter Mischel. Immediate small reward vs. large reward deferred under difficult conditions. "Ten of fifteen years later, a large gap had opened between those who had resisted temptation and those who had not. The resisters had higher measures of executive control in cognitive tasks, and especially the ability to reallocate their attention effectively."

 * pp. 47-48: The testers found that training attention not only improved executive control; scores on nonverbal tests of intelligence also improved and the improvement was maintained for several months."

 * Shane Frederick. "cognitive reflection tests". (See Ch. 5)

 * "Individuals who uncritically follow their intuitions about puzzles are also prone to accept other suggestions from System 1. In particular, they are impulsive, impatient, and keen to receive immediate gratification."

 * "System 1 is impulsive and intuitive; System 2 is capable of reasoning, and it is cautious, but at least for some people it is also lazy."

 * Keith Stanovich and Richard West. "System 1 and System 2", "Type 1 and Type 2 processes".

 * pp. 48-49: Keith Stanovich, _Rationality and the Reflective Mind_. Distinction between two parts of System 2: "separate minds". "Algorithmic" mind "deals with slow thinking and demanding computation."

 * "Stanovich argues that high intelligence doies not make people immune to biases. Another ability is involved, which he labels rationality. … The core of his argument is that rationality should be distinguished from intelligence. In his view, superficial or 'lazy' thinking is a flaw in the reflective mind, a failure of rationality." 

 * "The bat-and-ball question and others like it are somewhat better indicators of our susceptibility to cognitive errors than are conventional measures of intelligence."

## Ch. 4 The Associative Machine

### 1 [no subtitle]

 * pp. 50: Example of bananas + vomit. "Your mind automatically assumed a temporal sequence and a causal connection. … The state of your memory has changed in other ways: you are now unusually ready to recognize and respond to objects and concepts associated with" the two words. 

 * p. 51: "Your System 1 noticed the fact that the juxtaposition of the two words is uncommon."

 * This System 1 response is called **associative activation**: "ideas that have been evoked trigger many other ideas, in a spreading cascade of activity in your brain. The essential feature of this complex set of mental events is its coherence. … All this happens quickly and all at once, yielding a self-reinforcing pattern of cognitive, emotional, and physical responses that is both diverse and integrated — it has been called **associatively coherent**."

 * "System 1 made as much sense as possible of the situation … by linking the words in a causal story; it evaluated the possible threat (mild to moderate) and created a context for future developments by preparing you for events that had just become more likely; it also created a context for the current event by evaluating how surprising it was."

 * "System 1 treated the mere conjunction of two words as representations of reality."

 * "Cognition is embodied; you think with your body, not only with your brain."

 * pp. 51-52. **association of ideas**. David Hume's principles: "resemblance, contiguity in time and place, and causality."

 * "We no longer think of the mind as going through a sequence of conscious ideas, one at a time. … A great deal happens at once. … Most of the work of associative thinking is silent, hidden from our conscious selves."

### 2 The marvels of priming

 * p. 52: Measurement of **priming effects** is better than self-reported word-association tests.

 * p. 53: "Priming is not restricted to concepts and words."

 * John Bargh. "**Florida effect**": "words with an elderly theme" => walking slowly.

 * pp. 53-54: "**Ideomotor** effect": Two stages of priming: 1) words prime thoughts; 2) thoughts prime behavior.

 * Reverse "**Florida effect**" also observe: walking slowly => "words with an elderly theme"

 * "Reciprocal links are common in the associative network."

 * Fritz Strack; Ulf Dimberg: Forcing "smiling" or "frowning" using a pencil held in the month => changes in how funny 

 * Gary L. Wells. Being made to nod while listening to editorial => accepting the message.

### 3 Primes that guide us

 * p. 56: Priming by having referendum polled in school => greater support for school funding

 * Priming with images of classrooms and school lockers => greater support for school funding

 * pp. 55-56: Kathleen Vohs. Money-priming => individualism (independence, selfishness, preference for being alone)

 * Reminding people of their mortality => appeal of authoritarian ideas

 * p. 56: "Lady Macbeth effect": Thinking of being ashamed => words wash, soap; thinking of stabbing a coworker => buying detergent, soap, disinfectant

 * p. 57: "Disbelief is not an option. ... Priming phenomena arise in System 1."

 * pp. 57-58: Effect of image if eyes on "honesty box" for coffee and tea money

 * p. 58: "System 1 provides the impressions that often turn into your beliefs, and it is the source of the impulses that often become your choices and your actions. It offers a tacit interpretation of what happens to you and around you. ... It contains the model of the world that instantly evaluates events as normal or surprising. It is the source of your rapid and often precise intuitive judgments. ... System 1 is also ... The origin of many of the systematic errors in your intuitions."

## Ch. 5 Cognitive Ease

### 1 [no subtitle]

 * p. 59: Assessments are "carried out automatically by System 1, and one of their functions is to determine whether extra effort is required from System 2."

 * **cognitive ease**:

   * "no need to redirect attention or mobilize effort"

   * "connected to a large network of diverse inputs and outputs"

 * p. 59-60: **cognitive strain**:

   * "affected by both the current level of effort and the presence of unmet demands"

   * "less intuitive and less creative than uual"

### 2 Illusions of remembering

 * Larry Jacoby, "Becoming Famous Overnight". Priming the recollection of a proper noun. "You experience greater cognitive ease in perceiving a word you have seen earlier, and it is this sense of ease that gives you the impression of familiarity."

### 2 Illusions of truth

p. 62: "Predictable illusions inevitably occur if a judgment is based on an impression of cognitive ease or strain. … A reliable way to make people believe in falsehoods is frequent repetition, because familiarity is not easily distinguished from truth. … If you cannot remember the source of a statement, and have no way to related it to other things you know, you have no option but to go with the sense of cognitive ease."

### 3 How to write a persuasive message

 * p. 62-63: "Anything you can do to reduce cognitive strain will help, so you should first maximize legibility."

 * p. 63: "If your message is to be printed, use high-quality paper to maximize the contrast between characters and their background."

 * "If you use color, you are more likely to be believed if your text is printed in bright blue or red than in middling shades of green, yellow, or pale blue."

 * "Do not use complex language where simpler language will do." Danny Oppenheimer, "Consequences of Erudite Vernacular…": "Couching familiar ideas in pretentious language is taken as a sign of poor intelligence and low credibility."

 * "In addition to making your message simple, try to make it memorable. Put your ideas in verse if you can; they will be more likely to be taken as truth."

 * p. 64: "If you quote a source, choose one with a name that is easy to pronounce."

 * "Remember that System 2 is lazy and that mental effort is aversive."

 * "All of us live much of our life guided by the impressions of System 1 — and we often do not know the source of these impressions."

### 4 Strain and effort

 * p. 64-65: "Self-reinforcing reciprocity is found in studies of cognitive ease. … Cognitive strain is experienced when the effortful operations of System 2 are engaged. … The experience of cognitive strain … tends to mobilize System 2."

 * Shane Frederick's Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT): 1) bat-and-ball problem; 2) machines making widgets; 3) lily pad patch doubling in size.

 * "Cognitive strain, whatever its source, mobilizes System 2, which is more likely to reject the intuitive answer suggested by System 1."

### 5 The pleasure of cognitive ease

 * p. 66: "Easily pronounced words evoke a favorable attitude."

 * Robert Zajonc. **Mere exposure effect**: "link between the repetition of an arbitrary stimulus and the mild affection that people eventually have for it." Turkish words presented without explanation in a series of ads — those seen more favorably were felt to "mean something good".

 * p. 67: "The mere exposure effect is actually stronger for stimuli that the individual never consciously sees."

 * Zajonc argues that the mere exposure effect is "a profoundly important biological fact" extending to all animals. If "the repeated exposure of a stimulus is followed by nothing bad," then "such a stimulus will eventually become a safety signal, and safety is good."

### 6 Ease, mood, and intuition

 * p. 67: Sarnoff Mednick. Creativity as associative memory.

 * p. 68-69: Remote Association Test (RAT): deciding whether a triad of words are related

   * accurate guesses are much faster than getting the actual answer

   * good mood improves accuracy of guesses

 * "Mood evidently affects the operation of System 1."

 * "Good mood, intuition, creativity, gullibility, and increased reliance on System 1 form a cluster."

 * Cognitive ease registers as a slight smile, measurable by electrical activity in facial muscles.

 * "Good feelings actually lead to intuitions of coherence."
 
 * p. 70: Experiment attributing good feelings to music while RAT was conducted — eliminated the intuition of coherence. "The brief emotional response that follows the presentation of a triad of words (pleasant if the triad is coherent, unpleasant otherwise) is actually the basis of judgments of coherence."

## Ch. 6 Norms, Surprises, and Causes

### 1 [no subtitle]

P. 71: The spreading of activation in the associative machine is automatic, but we (System 2) have some ability to control the search of memory, and also to program it so that the detection of an event in the environment can attract attention.

### 2 Assessing normality

 * p. 71-72: "The main function of System 1 is to maintain and update a model of your personal world, which represents what is normal in it. … Surprise … is the most sensitive indication of how we understand our world and what we expect from it."
 
 * p. 72: "There are two main varieties of surprise. Some expectations are active and conscious. … But there is a much larger category of events that you expect passively; you don't wait for them, but you are not surprised when they happen."
 
 * p. 73: "[Reoccurences of a surprising event] appear normal because they recruit the original episode, retrieve it from memory, and are interpreted in conjunction with it."
 
 * **The Moses illusion**: "How many animals of each kind did Moses take into the ark?" … "As with the triads that produce cognitive ease, you unconsciously detect associative coherence between 'Moses" and 'ark" and so quickly accept the question."
 
 * p. 74: "Studies of brain responses have shown that violations of normality are detected with astonishing speed and subtlety."
 
 * "System 1, which understands language, has access to norms of categories, which specifiy the range of plausible values as well as the most typical cases."

### 3 Seeing causes and intentions

 * p. 75: "Finding … causal connections is part of understanding a story and is an automatic operation of System 1. System 2, your conscious self, was offered the causal interpretation and accepted it. … We have limited information about what happened on a day, and System 1 is adept at finding a coherent causal story that links the fragments of knowledge at its disposal."
 
 * p. 76: Albert Michotte. "We _see_ causality, just as directly as we see color." Experiment with black squares on paper — "illusion of causality."
 
 * "We are evidently ready from birth to have _impressions_ of causality, which do not depend on reasoning about patterns of causation. They are products of System 1.

 * Heider & Simmel, perception of intentional causality. Abstract shapes, viewed anthropomorphically, vying around a doorway.

 * "Your mind is ready and even eager to identify agents, assign them personality traits and specific intentions, and view the actions as expressing individual propensities."

 * p. 77: "The experience of freely willed action is quite separate from physical causality."

 * Paul Bloom. "our inborn readiness to separate physical and intentional causality explains the near universality of religious beliefs."

 * "People are prone to apply causal thinking inappropriately, to situations that require statistical reasoning. Statistical thinking derives conclusions about individual cases from properties of categories and ensembles."

## Ch 7. A Machine for Jumping to Conclusions

### 1 Neglect of ambiguity and suppression of doubt

P. 79-80: figure confusing B and 13 and an ambiguous sentence. "System 1 does not keep track of alternatives that it rejects, or even the fact that there were alternatives. Conscious doubt is not in the repertoire of System 1; it requires maintaining incompatible interpretations in mind at the same time, which demands mental effort. Uncertainty and doubt are the domain of System 2."

### 2 A bias to believe and confirm

 * pp. 80-81: Daniel Gilbert. "Understanding a statement must begin with an attempt to believe it: you must first know what the idea would mean if it were true. Only then can you decide whether or not to _unbelieve_ it. The initial attempt to believe is an automatic operation of System 1, which involves the construction of the best possible interpretation of the situation. "

 * "Gilbert sees unbelieving as an operation of System 2." Experiment: nonsense assertions, to be labelled true or false, and memory of these labellings was later tested. Disruption by requiring digits to be memorized "made it difficult for people to 'unbelieve' false sentences."

 * "The moral is significant: when System 2 is otherwise engaged, we will believe almost anything."

 * "People are more likely to be influenced by empty persuasive messages, such as commercials, when they are tired and depleted."

 * "The operations of associative memory contribute to a general **confirmaton bias**."

 * "The confirmation bias of System 1 favors uncritical acceptance of suggestions and exaggeration of the likelihood of extreme and improbable events."

### 3 Exaggerated e!optional coherence (halo effect)

 * p. 82: "The tendency to like (or dislike) everything about a person - including things you have not observed - is known as the **"halo effect**. ... It is one of the ways the representation of the world that System 1 generates is simpler and more coherent than the real thing."

 * Solomon Asch. two people described by the same traits but in reverse order; earlier it!s have a greater effect on our view of each person. "Evidence accumulates gradually and the interpretation is shaped by the emotion attached to the first impression."

 * "The halo effect is also an example of **suppressed ambiguity**."

 * p. 83: "Sequence matters ... because the halo effect increases the weight of first impressions, sometimes to the point that subsequent information is mostly wasted."

 * pp. 83-84: Grading student exams - changed from reading all of each student's in sequence, to reading each essay for all students and trading with your reference to other grades.

 * p. 84: "The consistency i had enjoyed earlier was spurious; it produced a feeling of cognitive ease, and my System 2 was happy to lazily accept the final grade."

 * pp 84-85: "The procedure I adopted to take the halo effect conforms to a general principle: **decorrelate error**! ... To derive the most useful information from multiple sources of evidence, you should always try to make these sources independent of each other. ... Eliminating redundancy from your sources of information is always a good idea." 

 * "Before an issue is discussed, all members of the committee should be asked to write a very brief summary of their position. ... The standard practice of open discussion gives too much weight to the opinions of those who speak early and assertively, causing others to line up behind them."

### 4 What you see is all there is (WYSIATS)

 * p. 85: "An essential design feature of the associative machine is that it represents only activated ideas. Information that is not retrieved (even unconsciously) from memory might as well not exist."

 * "The measure of success for System 1 is the coherence of the story it manages to create. The amount and quality of the data on which the story is based are largely irrelevant."

 * p. 86: System is expected to influence even the more careful decisions. It's input never ceases."

 * **WYSIATS**: Jumping to conclusions on the basis of limited evidence is ... important to an understanding of intuitive thinking."

 * pp. 86-87: Amos Tversky. "The presentation of one-sided evidence had a very pronounced effect on judgments. ... it is the consistency of the information that matters for a good story, not its completeness. Indeed, you will often find that knowing little makes it easier to fit everything you know into a coherent pattern."

 * "WYSIATI facilitates the achievement of coherence and of the cognitive ease that causes us to accept a statement as true. It explains why we can think fast, and how we are able to make sense of partial information in a complex world."
 
 * pp. 87-88: "It also helps explain: a long and diverse list of biases of judgment and choice, including:" overconfidence, **framing effects** (alternative and equivalent formulations), **base-rate neglect** (ignoring differences in sample size).

## Ch. 8 How Judgments Happen

### 1 [no subtitle]

 * p. 89: **basic assessments**: "System 1 continuously monitors what is going on outside and inside the mind, and continuously generates assessments of various aspects of the situation without specific intention and with little or no effort"
 
 * System 1 has "the ability to translate values across dimensions."
 
 * System 1 has the **mental shotgun**

### 2 Basic assessments

 * p. 90: "System 1 has been shaped by evolution to provide a continuous assessment of the main problems that an organism must solve to survive."
 
 * Alex Todorov. "We are endowed with an ability, in a single glance at a stranger's face, two potentially crucial facts about that person: how dominant ;;; his is, and how trustworthy he is."
 
 * "The shape of the face provides the cues for assessing dominance."
 
 * "Facial expression ... provides the cues for assessing the stranger's intentions.
 
 * pp. 90-91: Alex Todorov. Ratings of competence (based on brief exposure to photographs and without any political context) were far more predictive of voting outcomes ... than ratings of likability. "Todorov has found that people judge competence by combining the two dimensions of strength and trustworthiness." 
 
 * p. 91: **Judgment heuristic**: voters "fall back on a simpler assessment that is made quickly and automatically and is available when System 2 must make its decision."
 
 * "The effect of facial competence on voting is about three times larger for information-poor and TV-prone voters than for others who are better informed and watch less television. Evidently, the relatively importance of System 1 in dtermining voting choices is not the same for all people."
 
 * Assessments include:
 
   * computations of similarity and representativeness
   * attributions of causality
   * evaluations of the availability of associations and exemplars

 * Assessments "are performed even in the absence of a specified ask set, although the results are used to meet task demands as they arise.
 
 * pp. 91-92: example of two towers of blocks and a pile of unstacked blocks — you can't tell how tall a tower you could build of the unstacked blocks, and only System can figure it out.

### 3 Sets and prototypes

 * pp. 92-93: figuring average length of some lines (System 1, impressionistic) vs. total length of some lines (System 2, computation)
 
 * "Because System 1 represents categories by a prototype or a set of typical exemplars, it deals well with averages but poorly with sums. The size of the category, the number of instances it contains, tends to be ignored in judgments of what I will call **sum-like variables**."
 
 * Exxon Valdez oil spill experiment. "If saving birds is an economic good it should be a um-like variable: saving 200,000 birds should be worth much more than saving 2,000 birds. In fact the average contributions of the three groups were $80, $78, and $88 respectively. What the participants reacted to, in all three groups, was a prototype. .. The almost complete neglect of quantity in such emotional contexts has been confirmed many times."

### 4 Intensity matching

 * pp 93-94: "**Underlying dimension** of intensity or amount, which permits the use of the word _more_. System 1: "An underlying scale of intensity allows matching across diverse dimensions."
 
 * p. 94: "In classic experiments, people adjusted the loudness of a sound to the severity of crimes."
 
 * "This mode of prediction by matching is statistically wrong — although it is perfectly natural to System 1, and for most people except statisticians it is also acceptable to System 2.

### 5 The mental shotgun

 * p. 95: "System 1 carries out many computations at any one time. Some of these are routine assessments that go on continuously." Example of 3D representation of what is in the field of vision.
 
 * "No intention is needed to trigger this operation or the continuous monitoring for violated expectations. ... Other computations are undertaken only when needed"
 
 * "Control over intended computations is far from precise: we often compute much more than we want or need. I call this excess computation the **mental shotgun**. It is impossible to aim at a single point with a shotgun because it shoots pellets that scatter."

 * Experiment: Identifying rhyming words by sound — participants are influenced by the spelling. "Although the instructions required only a comparison of sounds, the participants also compared their spelling, and the mismatch on the irrelevant dimension slowed them down. An intention to answer one question evolked another, which was not only superfluous but actually detrimental to the main task."
 
 * Experiment: Identifying whether a heard sentence is literally true or not literally true. Metaphorically true sentences take longer to react to. "Here again, the intention to perform one computation evoked another. And here again, the correct answer prevailed in the conflict, but the conflict with the irrelevant answer disrupted performance."

## Ch. 9 Answering an Easier Question

### 1 [No subtitle]

 * p. 97: "A remarkable aspect of your mental life is that you are rarely stumped. ... Whether you state them or not, you often have answers to questions that you do not completely understand, relying on evidence that you can neither explain nor defend."

### 2 Substituting questions

 * p. 97: "If a satisfactory answer to a hard question is not found quickly, System 1 will find a related question that is easier and will answer it." "**Substitution**."
 
 * **target question**: the assessment you intend to produce
 * **heuristic question**: the simpler question that you answer instead
 
 * p. 98: Idea of substitution came up in asking "how people manage to make judgments of probability without knowing precisely what probability is. ... When called upon to judge probability, people actually judge something else and believe they have judged probability."
 
 * George Pólya advised substituting an easier question for a harder question (as a System 2 tactic). System 1 uses the same tactic as part of the mental shotgun.
 
 * "You are not limited to perfectly reasons answers to questions. There is a heuristic alternative to careful reasoning, which sometimes works fairly well and sometimes leads to serious errors."

 * p. 99: "The mental shotgun makes it easy to generate quick answers to difficult questions without imposing much hard work on your lazy System 2."
 
 * Heuristic "answers need to be fitted to the original questions." "Another capability of system 1, **intensity matching**, is available to solve that problem.
 
 * "The automatic processes of the mental shotgun and intensity matching often make available one or more answers to easy questions that could be mapped onto the target question. ... A lazy System 2 often follows the path of least effort and endorses a heuristic answer without much scrutiny of whether it is truly appropriate."
 
 * "You may not even notice that you did not answer the question you were asked. Furthermore, you may not realize that the target question was difficulty, because an intuitive answer to it came readily to mind."

### 3 The 3-D heuristic

 * p. 100-101: Perspective illusion: which figure is larger? "For most of us, this impression of 3-D size is overwhelming. Only visual artists and experienced photographers have developed the skill of seeing the drawing as an object on the page. For the rest of us, substitution occurs: the dominant impression of 3-D size dictates the judgment of 2-D size. The illusion is due to a 3-D heuristic."

 * p. 101: "A judgment that is based on substitution will inevitably be biased in predictable ways. In this case, it happens so deep in the perceptual system that you simply cannot help it."

### 4 The mood heuristic for happiness.

 * pp. 101-102: Experiment: different correlations found between answers to two questions, depending on the other in which they are asked. When the first question produces an emotional reaction, the answer to the second question is affected. Participants "substituted the question to which they had a ready-made answer for the question they were asked."

### 5 The affect heuristic

 * p. 103: The dominance of conclusions over arguments is most pronounced where emotions are involved. 
 
 * Paul Slovic. **Affect heuristic**: people letting their likes and dislikes determine their beliefs about the world. "Your emotional attitude to ... things ... drives your beliefs about their benefits and their risks."
 
 * "The primacy of conclusions does not mean that your mind is completely closed. ... However, the information about lower risks will also change your view of the benefits (for the better) even if nothing was said about benefits in the information you received."
 
 * "System 2 [is] a more or less acquiescent monitor, which allows considerable leeway to System 1. ... Active in deliberate memory search, cpmlex computations, comparisons, planning, and choice. ... It appear[s] that System 2 is ultimately in charge, with the ability to resist the suggestions of System 1, slow things down, and impose logical analysis. Self-criticism is one of the functions of System 2."

 * pp. 103-104: "We see here a new side of the 'personality' of System 2. ... In the context of attitudes, System 2 is more of an apologist for the emotions of system1 than a critic of those emotions — an endorser rather than an enforcer. Its search for information and arguments is mostly constrained to information that is consistent with existing beliefs, not with an intention to examine them. An active, coherence-seeing System 1 suggests solutions to an undemanding System 2."
