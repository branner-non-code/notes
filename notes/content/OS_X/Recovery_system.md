Recovery system
===============

> OS X Lion or OS X Mountain Lion includes a built in set of utilities 
> in the Recovery System. Restart your Mac and hold down the Command key 
> and the R key (Command-R), and keep holding them until the Apple icon 
> appears, indicating that your Mac is starting up. After the Recovery 
> System is finished starting up, you should see a desktop with a OS X 
> menu bar and a "Mac OS X Utilities" application window. Note: If you 
> see a login window or your own desktop and icons, it is possible that 
> you didn't hold Command-R early enough. Restart and try again.

In order to reinstall OS X Lion or OS X Mountain Lion, you will need to 
> be connected to an Ethernet or Wi-Fi network. The Wi-Fi menu item is 
> in the upper-right corner of the screen. Click the icon to display all 
> available Wi-Fi networks. Click your preferred network name and, if 
> needed, enter a username and/or password.
