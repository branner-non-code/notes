## Monads discussion

From Jason Owen (20161029):

> The blog post I mentioned turns out to be a pair of blog posts on the same subject, one which refers to another. The newer one is The ["What Are Monads?" Fallacy](https://two-wrongs.com/the-what-are-monads-fallacy), and it links to [Abstraction, intuition, and the "monad tutorial fallacy"](https://byorgey.wordpress.com/2009/01/12/abstraction-intuition-and-the-monad-tutorial-fallacy/). Together, they've helped me clarify my thinking on this tool that I haven't yet understood, and they've given me a simple (although not necessarily easy) path to understand it: learn to use specific monads.
