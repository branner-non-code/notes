## Install all dependencies with pip

Use

    pip install <package>[name]

where `<package>` is the main program. The brackets in `[name]` are required.

There is also an option

    pip install --process-dependency-links <package>

which seems to do a good job of getting dependencies installed. It is scheduled to be discontinued at some point, though.
