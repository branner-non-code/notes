# Preventing iTunes updates

1. When update is offered, rather than choosing one of the buttons offered, go to the menus and discontinue further updates. Then decline present update.

1. The third-party shareware application Pacifist allows full installation of packages without any existing parts of them being left in place. That enables older versions of iTunes to be installed, without error messages due to incompatible config and other files.
