Saving to new file name
-----------------------

Assume original file named `original.txt`

1.  `:w new.txt`: saves copy to `new.txt` but continues working on
    `original.txt`.

2.  `:sav new.txt`: buffer is now named `new.txt` and also saved to that
    name.

3. `:saveas new.txt`: seems to have the same effect as `:sav new.txt`. True?
