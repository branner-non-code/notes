Inserting control characters
----------------------------

First use `ctrl-v` and then from the keyboard enter whatever you are trying to generate, the normal keyboard way.: ctrl-c, ctrl-g, or whatever.

For instance, after `ctrl-v`, use `CR` to generate `^M`. Entering the characters ^M alone will not work.
