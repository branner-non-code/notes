## Green Air Air Purifier error E1 (E001)

### Leave the unit off and unplugged overnight (min. 8 hours) with plate removed so it has a chance to reset

### Re-install plate, and start on level 1 purify to clear the code (unless there is some kind of loose connection inside the unit
that is preventing the unit itself from detecting the plate.

### Clean off the metal contacts that touch both sides of the plate with a small amount of ammonia.
