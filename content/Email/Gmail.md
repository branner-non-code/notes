## Gmail issues

### It's All Text

 From https://github.com/docwhat/itsalltext/tree/release-1.8.1#readme
 
 > Gmail, blogger, and other sites has the option to use "rich text editors". The editors act similar to a word processor. Due to the way these work, it isn't possible for It's All Text! find the textarea, it is hidden or, in some cases, absent.
 >
 > Workaround: Turn off the rich text editor, if possible.
